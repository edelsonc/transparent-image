# transparent-image
Simple command line tool for turning image backgrounds transparent.

Every have a project where you want to include an image but its pesky background in a
solid color? Not an expert in photoshop to fix it yourself? No problem! This script
provides a simple commandline tool to fix just that!

`transparent-image` requires `python3` and the `pillow` module. I recommend installing
